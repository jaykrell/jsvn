Flaw #6

The docs are very good.

However the reference doesn't give much in the way
of semantic description.

It is surprising that an experienced programmer MUST
depend on the tutorial.

There needs to be links from the reference back to the tutorial.

Perhaps merge the indices for Tutorial, Language Reference, Library Reference.
Or maybe that's what search is for.

On the other hand, way better than Perl.
